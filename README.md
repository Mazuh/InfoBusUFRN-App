## Setting up for development

Having Node 10 or 11 installed, change directory to this project's root and install dependencies
(with `yarn`, so if you don't have it, then run `npm install -g yarn` for it):

```sh
yarn install
```

Then run development Expo server:

```sh
yarn start
```

Your console will show instructions of how open the app on an emulated device or your own existing one.
