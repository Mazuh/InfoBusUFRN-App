## Available Scripts

Bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Use the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```sh
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

#### `yarn test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner.
